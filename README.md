# SMALL DISCRIPTION OF THE GENERATIVE TEXT MODEL :

GPT-Neo 1.3B is an open-source, autoregressive language model developed by EleutherAI, designed to generate human-like text based on a given prompt. It has 1.3 billion parameters and is trained on the Pile, a large and diverse dataset that includes text from books, academic papers, web pages, and more. GPT-Neo 1.3B performs well on a variety of natural language processing tasks such as text generation, completion, and summarization. It mimics the transformer-based architecture used in models like GPT-3 and is available for public use through Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers library. Although smaller than GPT-3, it offers a strong balance between performance and resource efficiency, making it suitable for developers and researchers looking to build text-based applications without relying on commercial APIs.
